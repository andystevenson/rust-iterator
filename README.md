D1. A set is a collection of distinct objects, none of which is the set itself.

D2. A set containing no elements is called a null set or an empty set.

D3. A set A is said to be a subset of a set B, denoted “A ⊂ B”, if every element of A is also an element of B.

Convention. We agree to consider an empty set to be a subset of every set.

D4. A set A is said to be equal to a set B, denoted “A = B”, if A ⊂ B and B ⊂ A.

T1. There is only one empty set.

D5. A graph is an object consisting of two sets called its vertex set and its edge set. The vertex set is a finite nonempty set. The edge set may be empty, but otherwise its elements are two-element subsets of the vertex set.

D6. The elements of the vertex set of a graph are called vertices (singular: vertex) and the elements of the edge set are called edges. We shall denote the number of vertices by “v” and the number of edges by “e”.
